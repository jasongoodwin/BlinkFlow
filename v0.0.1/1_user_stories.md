markdownCopy# Habit Tracker + Screen Break App: User Stories

## Core Feature 1: Screen Break Timer

1. As a user, I want the app to automatically dim my screen at regular intervals, so that I'm reminded to take breaks for my eye health.

2. As a user, I want the screen to remain dimmed for 20 seconds, so that I have a dedicated time to look away and rest my eyes.

3. As a user, I want a visual or auditory cue to look 20 feet away during the break, so that I follow the 20-20-20 rule effectively.

4. As a user, I want the ability to toggle the break feature on and off, so that I can disable breaks during times when they're not appropriate or needed.

5. As a user, I want to be able to customize the interval between breaks, so that I can adjust the frequency to best suit my work habits and eye care needs.

## Core Feature 2: Habit List Overlay

1. As a user, I want to see my habit list displayed as an overlay when my screen dims, so that I can review my habits during my break.

2. As a user, I want the overlay to show my remaining tasks for the day, so that I can prioritize my activities.

3. As a user, I want the ability to quickly mark habits as complete from the overlay, so that I can update my progress without interrupting my workflow.

## Core Feature 3: Daily Engagement Mechanism

1. As a user, I want the app to ensure I interact with my habit list at least once a day, so that I stay committed to my habit-forming goals.

2. As a user, I want the app to track my daily engagement with the habit list, so that I can see my consistency over time.

3. As a user, I want gentle reminders if I haven't checked my habit list by a certain time of day, so that I don't miss a day unintentionally.

## Core Feature 4: Administration Interface

1. As a user, I want to access an administration interface from the app's dock icon, so that I can manage my habits and app settings without disrupting my work flow.

2. As a user, I want to be able to add new habits to my list, so that I can expand and modify my habit tracking over time.

3. As a user, I want to be able to edit existing habits, so that I can refine my goals or correct any mistakes.

4. As a user, I want to be able to delete habits from my list, so that I can remove completed or abandoned habits.

5. As a user, I want to be able to adjust app settings such as break duration and frequency, so that I can customize the app to my personal preferences and work style.

6. As a user, I want to be able to view a summary of my habit completion rates, so that I can track my progress over time.

7. As a user, I want the administration interface to be simple and intuitive, so that I can quickly make changes and return to my work.

8. As a user, I want a prominent and easily accessible toggle switch to turn breaks on or off, so that I can quickly disable or enable the break feature as needed.

9. As a user, I want to be able to set the interval between breaks, so that I can customize the frequency to match my preferences and needs.

## Additional Considerations

1. As a user, I want the app to run in the background without significantly impacting my computer's performance, so that I can work efficiently.

2. As a user, I want the option to temporarily disable or snooze the screen dimming feature, so that I can accommodate situations where breaks are not feasible.

3. As a user, I want my habit data to be stored securely and locally on my device, so that I can maintain my privacy.

4. As a user, I want any changes I make in the administration interface to be immediately reflected in the break-time habit list overlay, so that my habit tracking remains up-to-date and accurate.

5. As a user, I want the app to remember my break toggle setting and interval between sessions, so that I don't have to readjust it every time I start my computer.
