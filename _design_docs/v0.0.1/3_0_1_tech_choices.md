# Technology Stack Specification

## Primary Language
- Rust (latest stable version)
  - Justification: Strong type system, memory safety, and performance. The ecosystem has matured significantly, making it suitable for cross-platform GUI development.

## Cross-Platform GUI Framework
- Iced (https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
  - Justification: Pure Rust, cross-platform, and designed with simplicity in mind. It has a gentle learning curve and promotes clean, readable code.
  - Alternative: Druid (if we need more complex widgets that Iced doesn't provide)

## OS-Specific Interactions
- Windows: winapi crate (https://crates.io/crates/winapi)
- macOS: core-foundation and core-graphics crates
- Linux: x11rb crate (https://crates.io/crates/x11rb) for X11, and smithay (https://crates.io/crates/smithay) for Wayland support

## System Tray
- tray-icon crate (https://crates.io/crates/tray-icon)
  - Justification: Cross-platform, pure Rust implementation with a simple API

## Data Storage
- SQLite via rusqlite crate (https://crates.io/crates/rusqlite)
  - Justification: Lightweight, serverless, widely used. The rusqlite crate provides a safe, ergonomic Rust interface.

## Serialization/Deserialization
- serde (https://crates.io/crates/serde) with serde_json for JSON handling
  - Justification: De facto standard in Rust, type-safe, and promotes clean code through derive macros

## Error Handling
- thiserror (https://crates.io/crates/thiserror) for error type definitions
- anyhow (https://crates.io/crates/anyhow) for error propagation
  - Justification: These crates simplify error handling and make it more idiomatic

## Async Runtime
- tokio (https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
  - Justification: Well-established, feature-rich, and has good documentation. We'll use it for any async operations (e.g., file I/O, possibly future network operations)

## Logging
- log crate (https://crates.io/crates/log) for the logging facade
- env_logger (https://crates.io/crates/env_logger) for the actual logger
  - Justification: Standard logging solution in Rust, easy to use and configure

## Date and Time Handling
- chrono (https://crates.io/crates/chrono)
  - Justification: Comprehensive date and time library with good ergonomics

## Testing
- Rust's built-in testing framework
- proptest (https://crates.io/crates/proptest) for property-based testing
- mockall (https://crates.io/crates/mockall) for creating mock objects in tests

## Configuration
- config (https://crates.io/crates/config) for configuration file management
  - Justification: Flexible, supports multiple formats, and has a clean API

## Code Style and Formatting
- rustfmt for code formatting
- clippy for linting
  - Justification: These tools are built into the Rust toolchain and help maintain consistent, idiomatic code

## Build and Dependency Management
- Cargo (Rust's built-in package manager)
- cargo-make (https://crates.io/crates/cargo-make) for defining complex build workflows if needed

## Considerations for Readability and Ease of Understanding
1. Prefer crates with good documentation and examples
2. Use crates that promote idiomatic Rust code
3. Minimize the use of unsafe code
4. Choose crates with APIs that align well with Rust's ownership and borrowing model
5. Prefer stable, well-maintained crates with active communities
