# Coding Standards and Architectural Guidelines

## 1. Architectural Principles

### 1.1 Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
- Organize the application into three main layers: Domain, Application, and Infrastructure.
- Use interfaces (traits in Rust) to define ports between layers.
- Implement adapters for external services and UI.

### 1.2 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Model the domain layer based on business concepts and rules.
- Use ubiquitous language throughout the codebase.
- Implement aggregates, entities, and value objects as appropriate.
- Define domain events for important state changes.

### 1.3 Dependency Inversion
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

## 2. Testing Philosophy

### 2.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing features (Red-Green-Refactor cycle).
- Aim for high test coverage, especially in the domain and application layers.

### 2.2 Test Organization
- Place unit tests in the same file as the code being tested, using Rust's `#[cfg(test)]` attribute.
- Organize integration tests in a separate `tests` directory at the root of the project.

### 2.3 Test Naming and Structure
- Use descriptive test names: `#[test] fn given_when_then()`
- Structure tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

## 3. Coding Style and Practices

### 3.1 Formatting and Linting
- Use `rustfmt` for consistent code formatting.
- Enable and adhere to `clippy` lints for idiomatic Rust code.

### 3.2 Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for functions, methods, variables, modules, and file names.
- Use PascalCase for types, traits, and enum variants.
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants and static variables.

### 3.3 Error Handling
- Use `Result` for functions that can fail.
- Create custom error types using `thiserror` for domain-specific errors.
- Use `anyhow` for error propagation in application-level code.

### 3.4 Comments and Documentation
- Write doc comments (`///`) for all public items.
- Use regular comments (`//`) to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
- Include examples in doc comments where appropriate.

### 3.5 Module Organization
- Keep modules small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use Rust's visibility rules (`pub`, `pub(crate)`, etc.) to control the public API surface.

## 4. Domain Layer Guidelines

### 4.1 Entities and Value Objects
- Implement entities as structs with unique identifiers.
- Use value objects for concepts that are defined by their attributes.

### 4.2 Aggregates
- Define clear aggregate boundaries to maintain consistency.
- Implement aggregate roots as the main entry points for domain operations.

### 4.3 Domain Services
- Use domain services for operations that don't naturally belong to a single entity or value object.

### 4.4 Repositories
- Define repository traits in the domain layer.
- Implement concrete repositories in the infrastructure layer.

## 5. Application Layer Guidelines

### 5.1 Use Cases / Application Services
- Implement use cases as structs with a single public `execute` method.
- Keep application services thin, focusing on orchestrating domain objects.

### 5.2 DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- Use DTOs to decouple the domain model from external representations.
- Implement `From` traits for converting between DTOs and domain objects.

## 6. Infrastructure Layer Guidelines

### 6.1 Adapters
- Implement adapters for databases, external services, and UI frameworks.
- Use the adapter pattern to keep infrastructure concerns separate from domain logic.

### 6.2 Configuration
- Use environment variables and/or configuration files for app settings.
- Implement a centralized configuration module.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 7.1 Logging
- Use the `log` crate for consistent logging throughout the application.
- Log important domain events and application errors.

### 7.2 Metrics
- Implement metrics collection for key performance indicators.
- Use a metrics library compatible with common monitoring systems.

### 7.3 Security
- Follow OWASP guidelines for secure coding practices.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization.

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Asynchronous Programming
- Use `async`/`await` for I/O-bound operations.
- Leverage the `tokio` runtime for managing asynchronous tasks.

### 8.2 Optimization
- Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Optimize critical paths identified through profiling.

## 9. Dependency Management

### 9.1 Crate Selection
- Prefer well-maintained, popular crates from the Rust ecosystem.
- Regularly update dependencies and review for security vulnerabilities.

### 9.2 Minimal Dependencies
- Only include necessary dependencies to keep the project lean.
- Consider vendoring small dependencies if they're unlikely to change.

## 10. Version Control Practices

### 10.1 Commit Messages
- Use semantic commit messages: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

### 10.2 Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for new development.
- Use pull requests for code review before merging into the main branch.

Remember, these guidelines should be treated as living documents. Regularly review and update them as the project evolves and the team gains more insights.
