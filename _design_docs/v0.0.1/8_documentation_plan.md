# Documentation Plan

## 1. Code Documentation
- Use Rust doc comments (`///`) for all public items (functions, structs, traits, etc.).
- Include examples in doc comments where appropriate.
- Document non-obvious decisions or complex logic with regular comments (`//`).

## 2. README
- Create a comprehensive README.md in the project root with:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Installation instructions
  - Quick start guide
  - Link to full documentation
  - Contribution guidelines
  - License information

## 3. API Documentation
- Use `cargo doc` to generate API documentation.
- Host the generated docs (e.g., on GitHub Pages) for easy access.

## 4. Architecture Documentation
- Create and maintain an ARCHITECTURE.md file explaining the high-level structure of the application.
- Include a diagram of the hexagonal architecture and main components.

## 5. User Manual
- Write a user manual covering all features and how to use them.
- Include troubleshooting guides and FAQs.

## 6. Development Guide
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with:
  - How to set up the development environment
  - Coding standards (link to our Coding Standards document)
  - Pull request process
  - Issue reporting guidelines

## 7. Change Log
- Maintain a CHANGELOG.md file documenting all notable changes between versions.

## 8. Design Decisions
- Document important design decisions and their rationales in a DECISIONS.md file.

## 9. Installation Guide
- Provide detailed installation instructions for each supported platform.

## 10. API Endpoints (if applicable)
- If the app exposes any APIs, document them thoroughly, possibly using a standard format like OpenAPI.

## 11. Database Schema
- Document the database schema and any migrations.

## 12. Configuration Guide
- Detail all configuration options and how to set them.

## 13. Performance Tuning
- Provide guidelines for optimizing the application's performance.

## 14. Versioning
- Clearly document the versioning scheme (e.g., Semantic Versioning) and how it's applied.

## 15. License
- Include a LICENSE file with the full text of the chosen license.

Ensure all documentation is kept up-to-date as the project evolves. Consider setting up a process to review and update docs as part of the release cycle.
